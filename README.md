#### Overview
This repository contains my personal contributions to the paper titled '[A System for Collection and Machine Learning Analysis of Aquatic & Semi Aquatic Ecosystem Acoustic Data in North Carolina.](./A%20System%20for%20Collection%20and%20Machine%20Learning%20Analysis%20of%20Aquatic%20%26%20Semi%20Aquatic%20Ecosystem%20Acoustic%20Data%20in%20North%20Carolina.pdf)'. In the paper, the sections I contributed to are marked in yellow and orange. If you prefer a concise version, you can refer to the [Selected Excerpts](./Selected%20Excerpts.pdf). This document contains only the sections for which I hold sole proprietorship and that are relevant to the software contained in this repository
#### Description

For my individual contribution to the research project, I tested various feature extraction methods (FEMs) on frog sounds. I then visualized the data extracted from these techniques. I also individually studied and collectively compared the machine learning performances for each FEM using the measured average accuracy and confusion matrices (See [Selected Excerpts](./Selected%20Excerpts.pdf)). I found that Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients performed best among all the FEMS we tested. Therefore, when we greatly increased the size of our data set and created more advanced machine learning algorithms, we used MFCC as our feature extraction method.


I collaborated with the other team members to vastly increase the size of our data set and to advance our machine learning code with neural networks. However, as I do not have sole properietorship over this software, it is not included in this repository. Nevertheless, you can access these projects from the links in the paper.
